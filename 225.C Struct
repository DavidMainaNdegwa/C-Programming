PROJECT

Create a program to find the differences 
between three complex numbers.

-Perform the subtraction between complex 
numbers by subtracting the real aprt of one 
complex number from other complex numbers and 
same for the imaginary part too.

PROJECT
#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct Complex {
    double real;
    double imagine;
}complex;

int main() { 

  complex c1 = {.real = 21.87,.imagine = 112.84};
  complex c2 = {.real = 13.34,.imagine = 30};
  
    complex difference;
    
 difference.real =c1.real - c2.real;
 difference.imagine = c1.imagine - c2.imagine;
  
  printf("Result is %.2lf - %.2lf",difference.real, difference.imagine);
   
   return 0;
}

OUTPUT
Result is 8.53 - 82.84
