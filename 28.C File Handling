in C there usually 3 steps when working with files
1.Open a file
2.Perform file operation
3.Close a file

OPEN A FILE
FILE* ptr; //To work with the file

fptr = fopen("test.txt", "r");
//basically opening a file is nothing but connnceting our c program
to the external file,in this case we are connecting our main.c file to
test.txt file.

// "r" indicates that we are opening the file in read mode
so we can only operate the read operartion on the file.
