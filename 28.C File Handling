-Able to read content from the file
-Write content from the file
-Write content to the file

in C there usually 3 steps when working with files
1.Open a file
2.Perform file operation
3.Close a file

1.OPEN A FILE
FILE* ptr; //To work with the file

fptr = fopen("test.txt", "r");
//basically opening a file is nothing but connnceting our c program
to the external file,in this case we are connecting our main.c file to
test.txt file.

// "r" indicates that we are opening the file in read mode
so we can only operate the read operartion on the file.

2.READ FILE

int main() {
FILE* fptr;

fptr = fopen("text.txt","r");
//fptr is a pointer that is used to read the file.fgets read the content of the file and stores it in the content array.
//"r" to read the file.
char content[1000];

if(fptr != NULL) {
fgets(content,1000,fptr);
/*fgets reads the content of the file amnd stores it in
the content area and the thousand is the size of file
that is to be stored*/

printf("%s",content);
}
else{
printf("File Open Unscuccessful");
}

fclose(fptr);
return 0;
}

OUTPUT
This is a text file
//This is the first sentence we are able to get because
fgets can only read the first sentence at a time.

//if we want to read all the lines,we can use a loop.
while(fgets(content,1000,fptr)){
printf("%s",content);
}

fclose(fptr);
return 0;
//When we want to close the file.

3.WRITE CONTENT TO THE FILE
1.We need to open the file.
2."w" was the second parameter instead of r with the fopen function.fptr = fopen("newfile.txt","w");
fputs("I love C Programming",fptr);
fputs("C Programming series is the best",fptr);

PROJECT
Create a new file in write mood

Write Content
-C is a fun programming language.
-And,i love using c language.

Close the file 

Again open the file in read mode and read the content of the file.
# include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE* fptr;

  fptr = fopen("newFile.txt","w");

fputs("C is  a fun programming language\n",fptr);
fputs("And,i love using C langauge",fptr);


fclose(fptr);

  return 0;
}

READ THE CONTENT OF THE FILE
int main() {
  FILE* fptr;

  fptr = fopen("newFile.txt","r");

char content[1000];

if(fptr != NULL) {
  while(fgets(content,1000,fptr)){
    printf("%s",content);
  }
}


fclose(fptr);

  return 0;
}
