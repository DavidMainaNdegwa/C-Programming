Foward slashes,//,followed by text to make our program easier to understand for everyone.

Prevent executing code using comments
- it is common practise to cooment code so that it can be ignored rather than removing them completely.
eg; // double number = 32;

// printf("%lf", number);

Multiline comments in C
eg;
/* This program takes input from user,
it stores it in the age variable and,
print the value using printf()  */

Why are comments important?
-Helps one to understand one's own code months after programming
-Helps a client to customize new features
-Saves time during programming
